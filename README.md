Travel Booking System
Project Overview
This project is a simple Travel Booking System backend application powered by Node.js and Express.js. It sets up a basic server that handles HTTP requests and responses. The server currently runs a simple route to demonstrate the functionality and can be extended further for real-world use cases.

Technologies Used
Node.js (v20+ preferred for stability)
Express.js (Web framework)
NPM (Node Package Manager)

Installation Steps
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Step 1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (Recommended LTS version: 20.x)
NPM (Comes with Node.js)
Verify installations:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the project from your source (e.g., GitHub):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel_booking_system.git
cd travel_booking_system
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the project root directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Step 4: Run the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend folder and start the server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
By default, the server will run at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
How It's Working
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how the project works:

1. Backend Server Setup
The backend server is built using Express.js.
The index.js file is the entry point of the server.
It initializes the Express server and listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specific port (5000).
Example Code in backend/index.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express'); // Import express
const app = express();

const PORT = 5000; // Define a port number

// Basic route: Respond to GET requests at "/"
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Server is running...');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
2. Route Handling
The server listens for requests made to the root endpoint /.
When a user visits http://localhost:5000/ in their browser or makes a GET request to this route, the server sends back a simple message: "Server is running...".
3. Package.json Configuration
The package.json file includes metadata and scripts to manage the server:

Example Configuration:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "travel-booking-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "backend/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node backend/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
"scripts": Defines commands like npm start to run the server.
"dependencies": Lists required modules, such as express.
4. How to Run the Server
Use npm start to execute the server script in backend/index.js.

The server starts and logs a confirmation message:

arduino
Copy code
Server running on http://localhost:5000
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000/. You will see the response "Server is running...".

5. Troubleshooting
Issue 1: require is not defined

Cause: "type": "module" is present in package.json, making the project use ES Modules.
Solution: Remove "type": "module" or rename index.js to index.cjs.
Issue 2: MODULE_NOT_FOUND Error

Cause: File paths are incorrect, or dependencies are missing.
Solution:
Verify the backend/index.js file exists.
Reinstall dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Future Enhancements
Add more routes (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) to handle CRUD operations.
Integrate a frontend UI using React.js or plain HTML/CSS.
Connect a database like MongoDB or MySQL to store booking data.
Add error handling, middleware, and API documentation (e.g., using Swagger).
Conclusion
This project sets up a basic Node.js and Express.js backend server. It listens for incoming HTTP requests, serves a simple response, and can be extended to include more complex functionality like routing, database integration, and a frontend UI.
